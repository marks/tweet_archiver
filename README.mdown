# Tweet Archiver

## What's that?

A Rails 3.1 app + EventMachine daemon that uses the Twitter Streaming API to continuously fetch and save tweets under certain criteria.

## Installation

Just like any Rails 3.x app:

    bundle install
    rake db:migrate
    rails server

Then, start the daemon:

    ./lib/daemons/twitter_logger.rb start RAILS_ENV=development

That should be everything. Now head up to localhost:3000, and start adding Twitter search subscriptions!
